COMP3421 3D World
=========
For this project I used various computer graphics techniques in JOGL to create a 3D scene with an avatar, an enemy and terrain mesh, trees, and roads.

Images
----
<h4>Portals:</h4>

![Portals](/../screenshots/screenshots/portals.jpg?raw=true "Portals")

<h4>Night Mode:</h4>

![Night Mode](/../screenshots/screenshots/nightmode.jpg?raw=true "Night Mode")

<h4>Enemies:</h4>

![Enemies](/../screenshots/screenshots/the_others.gif?raw=true "Enemies")

Shortcomings
----
There are some issues with the code:

* Lighting for avatar is incorrect (normals may be incorrect)
* Portal collision detection could be improved
* Night mode lighting could be done at fragment shader level to improve results
